1. Core Classes

    Employee: Represents an employee record (id, firstName, lastName, salary, managerId).
    EmployeeService: Contains the core logic for processing employee data, calculating salary discrepancies, and identifying long reporting lines.
    CsvReaderService: Handles reading data from the CSV file and converting it into a list of Employee objects.
    ReportService: Formats and prints the output reports to the console.
	CsvGeneratorService: Generates the csv file witht the provided name and no of records
    EmployeeAnalyzerApp (Main Class): The entry point of the Spring Boot application, orchestrating the data creation, loading and report generation.

2. Functionality

	CSV File Generation: The application generates the csv file if we want, by providing the properties in the application.properties file.
    CSV Data Loading: The application will read the CSV file, parse each line into an Employee object, and store them in a collection (e.g., a List).
    Salary Analysis:
        For each manager, calculate the average salary of their direct subordinates.
        Determine the minimum (20% above) and maximum (50% above) acceptable salary range for the manager.
        Compare the manager's salary to this range and report any discrepancies.
    Reporting Line Analysis:
        Identify the CEO (the employee with no manager).
        For each employee, trace their reporting line back to the CEO, counting the number of managers in the chain.
        Report employees with more than 4 managers in their reporting line.
    Reporting: The application will print the results to the console, clearly indicating:
        Managers earning less than they should (and the difference).
        Managers earning more than they should (and the difference).
        Employees with too long reporting lines.
    Unit Testing: JUnit tests will be provided to verify the correctness of the core logics.

3. Assumptions

    Valid Input: I'll assume the input CSV file is generally well-formatted according to the specified structure. Error handling will be included to manage potential issues like missing fields or invalid data, but I won't handle maliciously crafted CSVs.
    Manager Existence: I'll assume that every managerId references a valid Employee within the data set.
    Single CEO: I'll assume there is only one CEO (an employee with no manager).
